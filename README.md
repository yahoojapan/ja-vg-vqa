Japanese Visual Genome VQA dataset
==================================
 
We have created a Japanese visual question answering (VQA) dataset by using [Yahoo! Crowdsourcing](https://crowdsourcing.yahoo.co.jp/), based on the images from the [Visual Genome dataset](https://visualgenome.org/).
Our dataset is meant to be comparable to the freeform QA part of Visual Genome dataset.
The dataset consists of 99,208 images, together with 793,664 QA pairs in Japanese with every image having eight QA pairs.
 
## Annotation Format
 
The annotations are stored in a single JSON file. 
The data format is a subset of [Visual Genome dataset v1.2](https://visualgenome.org/api/v0/api_readme).
